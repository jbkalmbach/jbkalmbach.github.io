I am a research scientist at the [DiRAC Institute](https://dirac.astro.washington.edu/) in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Washington.

I develop software and algorithms as a member of the Active Optics System (AOS) team for the [Vera Rubin Observatory](https://www.lsst.org/) and the associated Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Rubin Observatory is currently under construction in Chile and when brought online the LSST will take images of the entire southern night sky for 10 years giving us an unprecedented, high-resolution movie of the cosmos.

My scientific interests focus on creating new tools and methods to study large, complex datasets like the LSST through simulations, machine learning and high performance computing. These interests take me across a range of astronomical topics from detecting the faintest asteroids in our Solar System to measuring the distances to far-off galaxies. I am a member of three LSST Science Collaborations: the LSST Solar System Science Collaboration (LSST SSSC), the LSST Informatics and Statistics Science Collaboration, and the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC) where I am the co-convener of the Photometric Redshifts Working Group.

In my free time I love to get outside any way I can from running the high trails of the Cascades to hiking along lakes and rivers with my family.
